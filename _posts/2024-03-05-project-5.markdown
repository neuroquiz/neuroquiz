## Submissions

It would be **Grand**  
it would be swell  
if only I remembered well.

Tip-of-tongue, yet I can’t explain  
this world of pain—  
mere tricks of my brain.

### Relationship to Research

This “poem” reflects my project regarding the interruptive effect of electrical pain, administered either on the head or the back on memory. The aim is to explore how it relates to resting-state signatures, and whether it can differentiate chronic migraine and chronic back pain patient populations from healthy controls.
