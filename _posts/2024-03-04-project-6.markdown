## Does

**Designing interactive and educational projects**  

We develop short and engaging gamified modules that invite members of the scientific community to actively interact with content. These modules are designed to spark curiosity, encourage self-assessment of scientific intuitions, and feature science-inspired short stories and poems.

**Combining expertise within the field of cognitive science**

We combine expertise from neuroscience, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology to create modules that are both fun and informative. This interdisciplinary foundation enables the platform to offer a diverse range of activities for the broader scientific community.

**Sharing resources**

We offer a growing library of scientific prompts, mini-games, and literary spin-offs, designed for the broader scientific community.

## What

**Five modules**

*real or not real?*

It can be difficult to tell what information is real and what is fake, especially with the rise of AI-generated news and science content and clickbait marketing tactics. We present a few examples for you to read and decide whether the information is real or not real, underlining the importance of reading thoroughly about a topic before believing the first thing you hear!

*wordle*

Our wordles feature basic neuroscience terminologies, offering a light and fun game for all :D

*connections*

The connections game invites players to group related neuroscience terms or concepts, ranging from brain regions named after scientists to color-based idioms for emotions. 

*multiple choice*

Pick THE one!

*stories and poems*

Literary expressions that bring curiosity, wonder, and reflection into dialogue with scientific ideas are values and appreciated.
